Some challenges to practice coding!

1. remove-duplicates-from-array.cpp: remove duplicates from an integer array. Sorting the array and shifting the duplicates to remove from the end!
  Time complexity: O(nLogn)
  Space complecity: O(1)
  
2. find-two-subarrays-of-equal-sum-by-removing-one-element.cpp: Is it possible to devide an array into two subarrays of equal sum by removing one elment?
  Time complexity: O(n)
  Space complecity: O(1)
